Got 3 tickets created as a user with each having different problems to be resolved. Logged in as Black Adam since I gave him access as a sys admin to see the tickets.

Started with the ticket indicating that the entire mobile banking is down which is a pretty big deal. Changed priority from normal to emergency, chose SLA as a SEV-A, and transferred this ticket to the sys admin. Support could take care of it, it depends on their skill level but with this ticket being a business impact, it was a good idea to transfer to sys admin

Using active communication to keep the team updated. As always, having a little fun hearing from your friendly neighborhood "Spider-Man" fixing and resolving the issue. Just an example of communication and working the issue until all tickets are resolved. Kind of seeing the cycles and experimenting with a glimpse of how it would be in a real life setting as a Help Desk Professional.
